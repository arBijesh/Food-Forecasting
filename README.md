# Food Forecasting

This repository contains a project on **Food Forecasting**, focused on analyzing patterns and trends in food sales and predicting future demand. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning for accurate demand forecasting.

---

## **Project Overview**

Food forecasting is a critical application for businesses in the food industry, enabling them to:

- Anticipate future food demand.
- Optimize inventory management.
- Minimize food waste and improve profitability.

This project applies data science techniques to identify factors that influence food demand and create predictive models for better decision-making.

## **Contents**

The repository includes the following files:

- **`Food Forecasting.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

---

## **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations to understand data patterns.
  - Identifying trends, seasonality, and key demand factors.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Creating derived variables to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Time series analysis.
  - Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
  - Evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

---

## **Dependencies**

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

### Steps to Run the Project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-forecasting.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd food-forecasting
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Food_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the notebook cells to preprocess data, analyze it, and build models.

## **Data**

The dataset used in this project includes information such as:

- Date
- Food category
- Sales volume
- Store or region details

The data has been cleaned and preprocessed within the notebook for analysis. For details, refer to the EDA section in the notebook.

---

## **Results**

The project achieves the following outcomes:

- Identification of key predictors for food demand.
- Prediction of future demand with high accuracy (e.g., [insert performance metrics like RMSE, MAPE]).
- Actionable insights for better inventory and resource planning.
